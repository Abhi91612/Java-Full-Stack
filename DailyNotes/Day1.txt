JRE = Java Runtime Environment (implemetation of jvm)
JVM = total dependent upon OS
JDK


DUE TO JVM java programs are platform independent.


compiler does mainly 
parsing = error check 
translation= convert source code to  executable form


class = vacubulary/ keywords 

alphabatics = 54 ( capital/small/_/$) +10 digits       for naming in variable 

VARIABLE CAN START FROM $ OR _ ALSO BUT NOT NUMBER



4 cases
1.lower case      2.UPPERCASE  3. TitleCase    4. camelCase


IN THE CONVETIONALL(not maindatory)

1) NAME SHOULD BE MEANINGFUL
2) CLASS NAME SHOULD BE IN TITLE CASE
3) METHOD , VARIABLE AND ARGUMENT  NAME SHOULD BE IN camelCase



if the name of class is not public then program can run

due to background compilation is used to check class name if class is public should match with file name otherwise return error.

===========
Every java program must haave main() method 
this method is responsible to start execution of java program and termination also .
JVM is a driver of the program first execute this.
Main method invoke / called by JVM.
