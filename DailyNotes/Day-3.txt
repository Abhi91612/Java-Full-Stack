OPERATOR
==========

operands type of arithematic  operators are numberic and return type of these operator is also numberic .(++ , --)

coparision operator used beetween numberic but return type is boolean .

logical operator  are boolean  and return type is boolean . 
&&(and )  , || (or) , ^ (Xor) , !(not)    


-> operator can be divided in to two cotegories

1) Unary operator (++, --, !)
2) Binary Operator( Rest of  others are in this cotegory)
 

in x=x+1 or x+=1 has proble of human mistake  becouse value 1 is given by programmer (we use ++ , --)to prevent  human mistake .

++x; // new value return
x++; // old value return 
in upper both statement increment will happen  but difference is return value

if both are  use not in loop so these upper both condition happen other wise increment will happen every iteration ; 
y=x++;
it become x=x+1 but y=x previus value 


this is a program  
int x=10,y;
y=x++ - ++x;
output is y=-2;

y=x++ - (++x - ++x)
output is 11 



for(int i=0; i<5; i=i++)  =>this is the infinite loop happen  becouse value will not increment with the use of assigment operarator return old value of i;
for(int i=0; i<5; i=++i)  => loop run by 5 times
