Condition operator
------------------
if(show()==10)    return type is int 
if(show())  return type is boolean
if(a+b)  errr -> return value not store

if can also be terminated by semicolon(;)



if(a<b); is valid declaration        -> end of if condition 
{        // this is not the body of if condition
	// this is a without condition block that will always run 
print(" Abhishek");
}
else{ //  err invaid -> without if
}



if (1);  // valid  
else{   // valid  if  if condition is true than else condition never run otherwise execute(run) the block of else 
}

important notes => // in If condition that it should be mendatory to write first condition (right side ) that condition that will return false value to avoid checking other condition 
to improve the time complexity of the program vice versa with OR operator       ///// to use short circuite benefit

actually elase if is not work that it is looking 
it's work like -> else{ if{  }}   because for  single line statement you can remove the curly({,}) braces 

nextInt -> non-static this method invoke takes value and from input and return the value;
